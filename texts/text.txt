Wind turbines
A report on the principles of operation and applications
by Danila Kuklianov (bachelor Science & Technology)
In this report we are going to talk about wind turbines: their history, applications and
classification and the physical forces making them work.
A wind turbine is a device that converts the wind's kinetic energy into electrical energy for
use in other devices. It does that by means of a rotor (shape dependent on the type of the
turbine) rotated by wind, which through this movement transfers the energy to the electrical
generator within, producing electrical power.
Wind turbines vary in size and shape, and thus find many applications throughout the
world. Wind energy being renewable, wind turbines are becoming increasingly important in
cutting down on fossil fuel use. They are also deemed the least polluting of renewable energy
sources.
History and the Modern day
Before the mass electrification, structures akin to the modern wind turbines have been
used to transfer the kinetic energy of the wind to other devices, most notably, millstones used
to grind grain or pumps used to move water.
The first concepted device based on this concept was described at some point in 10-70 AD.
However, earliest practical application arises around the 7th century AD in the form of verticalaxle windmills. First mentions of wind power usage in Europe is dated as 11th or 12th century,
and by 14th century it finds industrial use, as the Dutch used wind-powered pumps to drain
parts of the Rhein delta.
The first wind turbine to generate electricity was installed in 1887 by a Scottish academic
to charge batteries. Soon after wind turbines were successfully peer-reviewed for electricity
production in the US. Despite that, at least until WWI most wind turbines were still used to
translate kinetic energy to mechanical devices - it is reported that in Denmark alone, the
potential peak mechanical power output of wind turbines was around 30 MW by 1900.
First horizontal-axis turbine similar to the modern counterpart in both structure and
effectiveness was built in Yalta, USSR in 1931. First megawatt-class wind turbines would go on
to be built in the US, UK and elsewhere from 1941; however, until 1970s there was little
opportunity for wind turbine improvement as fossil fuel systems improved quicker and paid off
sooner. Only then, anti-nuclear protests spurring artisans to develop micro wind turbines lead
to a trend for improvement and enlargement of wind turbines.
In the 21st century, the increasing oil prices and global climate concerns have amplified the
trend of growth of renewable energy; for our current interests, it lead to wind turbines
increasing in size quickly (as can be seen on fig.1) and many solutions for the lack of space for
building turbines being concepted and implemented, such as offshore/floating wind turbines.
As of 2019, the total wind power in the world amounted to 6% of the world's electrical power
production, which sets it at around 1400 TW of power annually.
Classification and Structures
Wind turbines can primarily be classified into vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) and
horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs). Further subdivision exists within the types, as well as
several "unconventional" wind turbine concepts.
HAWTs, specifically ones with 3 blades, constitute the vast majority of the currently
available commercial wind turbines. They work having the rotation axis oriented parallel to the
wind direction, turned by either a wind vane or a yaw system, with blades positioned in front of
the generator compartment (called upwind rotor). Unconventional HAWTs include designs with
downwind rotors - behind the generator, ducted rotor turbines and counter-rotating turbines
with 2 rotors - one upwind and one downwind.
Since the rotor usually spins at a low
frequency, either the generator within the
system must be made with the slow rotational
frequency in mind or a separate gearbox installed
between the two parts. The latter leads to
additional potential problems with the system
and to its size increase.
The main disadvantage of HAWTs is the need
for exceptionally sturdy blade and mast materials
to be able to resist the wind; additionally, with
current technology blades cannot be
disassembled for transportation, limiting where a
HAWT can be installed. However, the last 40 years show that horizontal axis wind turbines are
easily scalable given proper materials, which makes them the most commercially viable.

rotor shaft etc.) being lifted into position.

VAWTs utilize the wind pushing on the rotor blades arranged around a vertical shaft. They
are inherently less scalable, and are most often installed in households or on top of devices like
lamp posts to provide some self-sufficiency. They can be classified into two main groups (fig. 3)
- Savonius type and Darrieus type: blades of Savonius type VAWTs cover the entire surface
"within" the turbine while blades in Darrieus type are located on a frame outlying of the shaft.
Advantages include eliminating the need for specific orientation, which helps on sites
where the wind direction changes often and makes it more viable to integrate VAWTs into
buildings, and the ability to place the rest of the system (the gearbox and the generator) on the
ground for ease of access.
However, there are many downsides to the vertical positioning. Apart from significant
torque fluctuations during one revolution, which is reduced greatly in modern VAWTs because
of the helical design ("Twisted" Savonius and Gorlov types), all such turbines have a
comparatively low power coefficient; since they rotate 360 degrees in the airflow, every side of
the blades must be able to resist similar loads dynamically, and modelling such interactions may
present a challenge for creating a VAWT without initial physical prototyping.
Other concepted or implemented wind turbines that do not fit in the aforementioned
categories include systems that would flex piezoelectric crystals or oscillate a magnet through
coiled windings due to airflow, a "solar updraft tower" that would use sun-heated air from a
reservoir to spin a turbine, and aerial wind turbines that would exploit the predictability and
increased velocity of wind at high altitudes.
Power Generation and Efficiency
Kinetic energy is equal to ½*mass*velocity^2 for general purposes.
E = ½*m*V^2
The mass of air passing through a given area per second is equal to velocity*area*density.
m(s) = V*A*p
Thus, ideally the power of airflow through a given area is equal to
½*area*density*velocity^3, which at sea level is roughly equal to 0.6*velocity^3 watts/m^2 of
rotor area.
P = ½*A*p*V^3
Figure 3. VAWT subtypes. The helical turbine here (or Gorlov type) is also, in principle, a Darrieus type.
While these formulas give us general wind power, they do not take into account the
effectiveness of parts constituting the energy converter; the total formula is
Pt = ½*Cg*Cb*Cp*A*p*V^3, where Cg is generator efficiency, Cb is gearbox efficiency and
Cp is the coefficient of performance.
Another approach is to evaluate power through the vector equation P = F*U, where F is the
vector of the force exerted by the wind and v is the vector of the rotor's velocity.
The velocity usually considered in such calculation is the blade tip speed U = w*r, where r is
blade radius and w is rotation speed of the rotor (rad/s).
For aerodynamic forces - drag and lift - we must instead use the relative velocity vector W
= V - U, where V is the wind speed.
In wind turbine physics those values are used after being non-dimensionalized, so we write
CL = L/(½pAW^2) where L is lift force and CL is lift coefficient, and CD = D/(½*p*A*W^2) where
D is drag force and CD is drag coefficient.
Additionally, we use CP = P/(½*p*A*W^3) - the power coefficient, λ = U/V - the velocity
ratio and γ = CD/CL.
Thus, depending on the type of the turbine - whether it exploits drag or lift force - the
equations can be written as follows, although drag force is present either way:
P = ½*p*A*CD*(UV^2 - 2*VU^2 + V^3) or CP = CD*(λ - 2* λ^2 + λ^3) for drag
P = ½*p*A*sqrt(U^2 + V^2)*(CL*U*V - CD*U^2) or CP = CL*sqrt(1+ λ^2)*(λ -γ* λ^2) for lift
Through use of experimentally determined drag and lift coefficients in these theoretical
formulas it has been shown that lift-based wind turbines are vastly more effective.
Even these equations, however, disregard some forces such as induced drag.
Figure 4. The histogram here shows experimental data, while curves are a distribution model for average wind speed.
Additionally, Betz's law implies that no wind turbine may be more than 59.3% effective due to
the fact that air still needs to flow after entering the turbine's space, and as such some of the
energy of the wind is spent on producing the flow after the turbine. Furthermore, real wind
turbines peak at 80% of that due to airflow "missing" the blades and generator/gearbox
inefficiencies.
Any deviation from "ideal" weather conditions or changes to the blade's surface will negatively
impact efficiency. Obvious examples are hot air being less dense and thus producing less flow
power, cold weather freezing parts of the mechanism or causing ice formation on the rotor;
other factors may include flying wildlife causing damage to the blades.

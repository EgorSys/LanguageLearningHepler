The diagram illustrates information about the evolution of the horse over a period of 40 million years with particular emphasis on the foot structure. There are four main stages in the process, form Eohippus to the modern horse.
The earliest form of the horse is called Eohippus, which was significantly smaller than our modern horse and had no mane on its upper back. After that, 10 million years later, Mesohippus replaces it, having a more muscular body. The next stage is Merichippus, which had a distinct mane on its upper back and head as well as a walking posture resembling that of a modern horse. The last stage is the modern horse.
Now let us look at the foot structure. The foot of Eohippus had 4 fingers. Having passed that stage, Mesohippus had only 3 fingers, one of which was noticeably larger than the other two. After that, in Merichippus we see further development is the size of the middle finger as well as bone mass of the foot in general. Finally, the foot of the modern horse consists of only one hoof, with no additional fingers.

With the worldwide development of technology and the subsequent need for specialists in that area, we see a clear dominance of technical subjects starting from secondary school. But there is an opinion that the school system should introduce more art-based subjects into the obligatory curriculum. I personally believe that students already have a big enough study load and that adding more obligatory classes further fuels existing stress problems.
Most teenagers around the world do not enjoy their classes in secondary school. This is largely due to puberty being mixed with an increase in pressure from primary school. So it is no surprise that the vast majority of students hate going to school at that age. Some people think that adding art subjects somehow will make the learning process fun, but the reality is that teenagers donâ€™t want to be forced to study anything regardless of the field. If a person dreams of becoming a mechanic, being obliged to study art and music may torture for them. Thus, keeping the number of obligatory subjects in secondary school as low as possible is the best course of action.
To sum up, increasing the amount of studies in secondary school will put further stress on the students, regardless of whether it is an art-based subject or not.

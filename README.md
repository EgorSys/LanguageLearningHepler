# LanguageLearningHepler
A program that helps find most relevant words in a text. It is meant to simplify the tedious process of trying to find the best words to add to your vocabulary when learning a language.
## What does it do?
1) You pick the resources (in this case texts) from which you want to get your vocabulary.
2) The program gives you the most relevant words.
3) (!in development) I am planning to add the ability to provide the most relevant text fragments to study.
